Welcome to Sludge's documentation.

Introduction
=============


Sludge is a **SaaS platform** for calculating the matrix like biochemical models (such as activated sludge models 1, 2 and 3). The aim of this project is to help people to build and calculate their own wasterwater treatment process easily.
The input of the whole process are only 3 excel xlsx files. By this way, you can check and make your own biological model conveniently.


The key features are:

- **Simple**:

  + only 3 excel files and you are good to go
- **Sharable**
- **Trackable**

`Sphinx Themes Gallery <https://sphinx-themes.org>`_.


Time Unit
==============
To unify the time unit in Sludge calcualtion, all time units will translated to ``'second'``.
There are 2 time units we should notice: **Parameter** and **Measured**.

Parameter
--------------
NOTE that Parameter time unit is fixed to be ``'day'`` and unchangable.
The Unit column in Parameter sheet of **BioModel.xlsx** is actually an annotation, it won't affect any calculation result.
For instant, if you set ``b_OHO_end`` (the endogenous respiration rate coefficient of ordinary heterotrophic organisms) to be 0.008 h :sup:`-1` (i.e. 0.2 d :sup:`-1`), it won't be recognized as 0.2 d :sup:`-1` rather than 0.08 d :sup:`-1`

 always be ``'day'``

So you should know the kinetics parameter time unit will always be ``'day'``.
.. E = mc\ :sup:`2`




Measured
--------------
Measured time unit is setted by the TimeUnit column (only 1st row) in Tank sheet of **DataSet.xlsx**, which could only be: ``'second'``, ``'minute'``, ``'hour'`` or ``'day'``.
The Component (Measured sheet) and Flow (Link sheet) data will follow this time unit.
