    about


Welcome to Sludge's documentation.

Introduction
=============


Sludge is a **SaaS platform** for calculating the matrix like biochemical models (such as activated sludge models 1, 2 and 3). The aim of this project is to help people to build and calculate their own wasterwater treatment process easily.
The input of the whole process are only 3 excel xlsx files. By this way, you can check and make your own biological model conveniently.


The key features are:

- **Simple**:

  + only 3 excel files and you are good to go
- **Sharable**
- **Trackable**



This is a demo site for |theme_display|, generated as part of
`Sphinx Themes Gallery <https://sphinx-themes.org>`_.


Time Unit
==============
The time unit will only follow the self.TimeUnit_SampleRate.
If the self.TimeUnit_SampleRate is minute, all the trace time will calculate follow minute, plot_target columns will follow self.TimeUnit_Measured.
not matter what, dt_one_second = 1s, this means grid will only calcualte 1s interval


timeunit_bioparameter is setted to be 'day' (in Project.bulid()) and cannot change.
