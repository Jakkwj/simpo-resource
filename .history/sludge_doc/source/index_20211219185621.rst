Welcome to Sludge's documentation.




Introduction
=============


Sludge is a **SaaS platform** for calculating the matrix like biochemical models (such as activated sludge models 1, 2 and 3). The aim of this project is to help people to build and calculate their own wasterwater treatment process easily.
The input of the whole process are only 3 excel xlsx files. By this way, you can check and make your own biological model conveniently.


The key features are:

- **Simple**:

  + only 3 excel files and you are good to go
- **Sharable**
- **Trackable**



This is a demo site for |theme_display|, generated as part of
`Sphinx Themes Gallery <https://sphinx-themes.org>`_.


Time Unit
==============
The time unit will only follow the self.TimeUnit_SampleRate.
If the self.TimeUnit_SampleRate is minute, all the trace time will calculate follow minute, plot_target columns will follow self.TimeUnit_Measured.
not matter what, dt_one_second = 1s, this means grid will only calcualte 1s interval


timeunit_bioparameter is setted to be 'day' (in Project.bulid()) and cannot change.

    This sample documentation was generated on |today|, and is rebuilt weekly.


Quickstart
==========

1. Install this theme:

   .. theme-install::

2. Set the following in your existing Sphinx documentation's ``conf.py`` file:

   .. theme-configuration::

3. Build your Sphinx documentation with the new theme! [1]_


Documentation
=============

|theme_documentation_message|


Exploration
===========

.. toctree::
    :hidden:

    kitchen-sink/index

The :doc:`kitchen-sink/index` section contains pages that contains basically
everything that you can with Sphinx "out-of-the-box". Browsing through that
section should give you a good idea of how stuff looks in this theme.


Navigation
==========

This is the most important part of a documentation theme. If you like
the general look of the theme, please make sure that it is possible to
easily navigate through this sample documentation.

Ideally, the pages listed below should also be reachable via links
somewhere else on this page (like the sidebar, or a topbar). If they are
not, then this theme might need additional configuration to provide the
sort of site navigation that's necessary for "real" documentation.

.. toctree::
    :caption: This is a caption
    :titlesonly:

    placeholder-one
    placeholder-two
    really-long-title
    long-page
    External Link <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>

.. toctree::
    :hidden:
    :caption: Additional "hidden" Pages

    placeholder-three
    placeholder-four
    Sphinx Theme Gallery <https://sphinx-themes.org>

Some pages like :doc:`placeholder-three` are declared in a "hidden"
toctree, and thus would not be visible above. However, they are still a
part of the overall site hierarchy and some themes may choose to present
them to the user in the site navigation.

-----

.. [1] If you hit an error while building documentation with a new theme,
    it is likely due to some theme-specific configuration in the ``conf.py``
    file of that documentation. These are usually ``html_sidebars``,
    ``html_theme_path`` or ``html_theme_config``. Unsetting those will likely
    allow the build to proceed.
