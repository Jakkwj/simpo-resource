Welcome to Sludge's documentation.

Introduction
=============


Sludge is a **SaaS platform** for calculating the matrix like biochemical models (such as activated sludge models 1, 2 and 3). The aim of this project is to help people to build and calculate their own wasterwater treatment process easily.
The input of the whole process are only 3 excel xlsx files. By this way, you can check and make your own biological model conveniently.


The key features are:

- **Simple**:

  + only 3 excel files and you are good to go
- **Sharable**
- **Trackable**



This is a demo site for |theme_display|, generated as part of
`Sphinx Themes Gallery <https://sphinx-themes.org>`_.


Time Unit
==============
There are 2 time units we should notice: **Parameter** and **Measured**. And all time units will translated to **`second`** to unify the time unit for whole calcualtion.

Parameter
--------------
Parameter time unit is fixed to be **'day'** and unchangable.
So the Unit column in Parameter sheet of ``BioModel.xlsx`` is actually an annotation, it won't affect the calcualte result.

Measured
--------------
Measured time unit is setted by the TimeUnit column (only 1st row) in Tank sheet of ``DataSet.xlsx``.
The Component (Measured sheet) and Flow data (Link sheet) will follow this time unit.




timeunit_bioparameter is setted to be 'day' (in Project.bulid()) and cannot change.
